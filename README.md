The goal of this is to use/learn previous/new knowlage to scale a prototype to production.
The techiques we are going to explore is the following:

- [x] BigQuery (featching data using Googles SQL could service)
- [x] Collabratory (creating the deep learning model using cloud computing notebook with dedicated GPUs)
- [x] Docker (creating a docker image for all the running dependencies)
- [ ] Tensorflow serving (use the trained model with tensorflow serving, google battletested deep learning serving framework)
- [X] Create a chatbot website using HTML, CSS, JS.
- [ ] Make this website client communicate to a django webserver using RESTful. (secure token)
- [ ] Django communicate to the tensorflow serving.
- [ ] Push this to kubernetes.
